A simple app to compare country trajectories in battling COVID-19, with shareable links. Should work on mobile.

Charts available:
- Cases (total / new / growth factor),
- Deaths (total / new / growth factor),
- Recoveries (total / new / growh factor).

Settings available:
- Correcting for population,
- Log / linear scale,
- Moving average,
- Starting all curves from same value of cases OR from same date.
